                Before Raid Encounters, M+, or Arenas can be recorded in SquadOV, we need to make sure our combat logs are recording properly.
                We recommend you use the assistance of a combat logging addon such as the <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/simplecombatlogger">Simple Combat Logger</a>.
